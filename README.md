## Overview

### The challenge

This is my attempt at the Expenses chart component solution. This challenge was very fun in testing my knowledge of how to not only dynamically load data to populate a bar chart, but also how to style the chart based on the data provided.

## My process

1. I first worked on the markup and some base/reset styling, before working through the styling of each section.
2. I refactored my CSS by way of utility classes.
3. I then worked on dynamically loading the bar chart data in Javascript, as well as dynamically styling the height of the bars.
4. I then worked on tweaking the layout (spacing, sizing) for smaller viewport sizes in accordance with the design images.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned about dynamic styling, particularly when dealing with an array of data instead of a singular piece of data.
